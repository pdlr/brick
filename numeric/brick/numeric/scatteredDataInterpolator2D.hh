     ** This class template implements the scattered data
     ** interpolation algorithm of Lee, Wolberg, and Shin [1].  This
     ** algorithm constructs bicubic 2D B-splines of progressively
     ** finer resolution to approximate input data.

     ** Template argument Type describes the quantity to be
     ** interpolated.  This is the type of the scattered data.
     **
     ** Template argument FloatType describes the type that will be
     ** used for internal calculations, and is typically set to float
     ** or double.
