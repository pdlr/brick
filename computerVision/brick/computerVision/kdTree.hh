     ** This class template is used by the KDTree class template to
     ** interact with the data points to be stored in the KD-Tree.  It
     ** provides functions for comparing points during a sort, for
     ** computing the distance between points, and for finding the
     ** lower bound on the distance between a particular point and the
     ** region of space represented by a particular branch of the
     ** KD-Tree.  Template argument Dimension specifies how many
     ** dimension the tree spans.  Template argument Type specifies
     ** what kind of element is contained in the tree.  Logically,
     ** Type represents a point in multi-dimensional space.  In order
     ** to work with this class template, Type must allow access to
     ** individual coordinates via Type::operator[](size_t), which
     ** will be called with arguments in the range [0 ... (Dimension -
     ** 1)].  Also, operator==(Type const&, Type const&) must return
     ** true if the two arguments represent the same point.
     **
     ** If you need to build a KD-Tree using a Type that doesn't
     ** support this interface, you can simply specialize KDComparator
     ** (or specific member functions of KDComparator) for your type.
     ** For an example of such a specialization, see the file
     ** brick/computerVision/test/kdTreeTest.cc.
