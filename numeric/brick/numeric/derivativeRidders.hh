     ** This class implements the algorithm described in [1] for
     ** numerically approximating first derivatives, which applies the
     ** Romberg method to numerical differentiation.  The paper also
     ** describes how to approximate higher order derivatives, but we
     ** haven't implemented that yet.  The implementation here
     ** includes termination criterion, test of estimated error, and
     ** table-based implementation from [2].
     **
     ** Template argument Functor is the the type of the functor that
     ** will be differentiated.  Template argument Scalar specifies
     ** what type will be used for internal calculations.
     **
     ** Note: we can make this run faster by following the
     ** implementation in [1].  We should be able to get better
     ** accuracy by making the finite difference step be exactly
     ** representable as described in [2], 230.  Perhaps we should
     ** build in an automatic check of estimated error, with restart,
     ** so as to minimize the number of failed estimates (see
     ** documentation for constructor parameter "stepBound").

       * @param stepBound This argument specifies the largest step to
       * use when computing approximate derivatives.  Setting it too
       * large will cause DerivativeRidders to terminate early with
       * large error estimate.  Setting it too small hurts accuracy.
       * Choose a value an order of magnitude or so smaller than the
       * "characteristic scale" (nominally f / f'' , corresponding to
       * the amount of parameter variation required to generate a
       * significant change in the function value) of functor.  Or
       * leave it at the default, don't panic, and check the error
       * estimate using member function getErrorEstimate().
       *
       * @param stepDecreaseFactor This argument specifies by what
       * factor to divide the finite difference step at each
       * iteration.  Ritters' paper sets it to 2.0, Press and Flannery
       * use 1.4.  Possibly 1.4 gives better estimates, but requires
       * more iterations to terminate.
       *
       * @param tableauSize This argument bounds how many finite
       * difference approximations will be used as input to the
       * Romberg method.  A each derivative calculation will take at
       * most twice this many function evaluations.
       *
       * @param backtrackFactor This argument corresponds to Press's
       * and Flannery's "SAFE" constant.  Iteration will terminate
       * when estimated error is greater than or equal to this number
       * times the best error estimate seen so far.
